# NEAT-cars
A basic complete ground up implementation of NEAT algorithm to enable cars to learn how to drive a user created track.
Built with inbuilt python libraries and Pygame for visualization.

Nice Video Series on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu5ul7z4icQ

Currently there is no functionality to draw the track.
- Draw the track using any image editing software ( Black colour => Path )
- The starting position of the car must be a path.
- The dimensions of the image should be 280x225 for perfomance
