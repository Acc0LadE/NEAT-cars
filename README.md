# NEAT-cars
A basic complete ground-up implementation of the NEAT algorithm to enable cars to learn how to drive a user-created track.
Built with inbuilt Python libraries and Pygame for visualization.

Currently, there is no functionality to draw the track.
- Draw the track using any image editing software ( Black colour => Path )
- The starting position of the car must be a path.
- The dimensions of the image should be 280x225 for performance

## Requirements
To run the script, you'll need the following Python packages:
- pygame==2.3.0

## Installation
To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install the required packages using pip.
